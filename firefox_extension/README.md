# Firefox Extension

This component of the overall application tracks any tab changes within the Firefox web browser. All of these corresponding state changes are propagated to the User Daemon through the native messenging protocol. 

To update this code, some steps are required. One can test locally by temporarily installing the extension from a folder. For a more permanent solution, visit the [Firefox development hub](https://addons.mozilla.org/) and register the extension. Once it is approved, one can permanently download the extension. Simply download the XPI file and Firefox will register the extension.
